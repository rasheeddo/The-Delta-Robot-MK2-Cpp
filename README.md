# The-Delta-Robot-MK2-Cpp
This project is developed from the first version of Delta Robot (No repository). The robot was upgraded as following...
1. Working range is expanded to 500mm max radius with max stoke of 600mm
2. The stiffness of the distal link is inceased due to none of ball joints are used. A custom designed of universal joints are used instead.
3. Drive unit is changed to XM540-W270-R instead of MX106-R Dynamixel for the reason of cost and performance.
4. The code is developed on c++, so it can run faster than the previous Python version. And has a possibilty to integrate with other platform like OpenKAI.
5. New gripper system, a two-fingers gripper
The actual robot with gripper are shown here.
